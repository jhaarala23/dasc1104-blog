**My name is Jacob Haarala.** I am currently an Honors Data Science student at the University of Arkansas in my freshman year. During my childhood I grew up parts in Wisconsin and Louisiana. I hope that someday this blog could help potentially springboard my professional career, and help me get some good job oppurtunities.
